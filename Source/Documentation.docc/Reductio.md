# ``Reductio``

Powerful text summarization and keyword extraction for Swift using the TextRank algorithm.

## Overview

Reductio is a high-performance Swift library that brings the power of automatic text analysis to your applications. Built with Swift 6's strict concurrency in mind, it provides a modern, safe, and efficient way to extract meaning from text through keyword extraction and automatic summarization.

### Key Features

- **üîë Keyword Extraction**: Identify the most relevant keywords using graph-based ranking
- **üìù Text Summarization**: Extract key sentences while preserving context
- **‚ö° High Performance**: Efficiently process documents up to 10,000+ words
- **üîí Thread-Safe**: Full Swift 6 strict concurrency compliance
- **üì¶ Zero Dependencies**: Pure Swift implementation

### How It Works

Reductio implements the TextRank algorithm, an unsupervised graph-based ranking algorithm inspired by Google's PageRank. The algorithm builds a graph representation of text where:

1. **Vertices** represent words (for keyword extraction) or sentences (for summarization)
2. **Edges** represent semantic relationships between elements
3. **Weights** are calculated based on co-occurrence patterns
4. **Ranking** is performed iteratively until convergence
